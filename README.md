VsVim
===
[VsVim](https://github.com/VsVim/VsVim) is a free vim emulator for Visual Studio 2019 through to 2026.
This is Viv's personal fork of VsVim. It may contain unstable or experimental changes. Please only use it if you are OK with that.

It has a unique extension id compared to VsVim, and having both extensions installed at the same time is *very* likely to cause problems.
